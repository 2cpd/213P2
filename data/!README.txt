The data folder contains stock images as well as txt files storing information about users and their files.

In its default state:
- user.txt = ",stock"

To do a manual reset of the app in case data gets corrupted, delete all other txt files except user.txt above and reformat them to its default values.

Any changes as the stock user will be reset at the start of the program (when Photos.java is run) to ensure data and program integrity.
