The data folder contains stock images as well as txt files storing information about users and their files.

In default state:
- user.txt = ",stock"
- stockalbum.txt = ",stockAlbum"
- stockphoto.txt = ";data/Bliss.jpg:stockAlbum;data/Hills.jpg:stockAlbum;data/Lilies.jpg:stockAlbum;data/Sunset.jpg:stockAlbum;data/Winter.jpg:stockAlbum"

To do a manual reset of the app in case data gets corrupted, delete all other txt files except these 3 above and reformat them to their default values.
